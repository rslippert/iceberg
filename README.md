# Iceberg 
Iceberg / Sagent (Smart Agent) AGI process automation software development
#
Artificial "General" Intelligence, or lets call it intelligence has not happened because of the following issues.
1) First, there needs to be a body of code that bootstraps instinctive processes that allow learning to happen.
 Iceberg Instincts is the body of code that defines the processes that allow for learning and also useful processes.
These useful processes will be software capabilities that are already developed within the many python modules.
The wealth of python modules can be converted into processes which in Iceberg are called Sagents.
2) A "Sagent" or smart agent is a new standard that defines smart (buildable) Iceberg processes.
Iceberg processes operate using smart agents (Sagents) that create and processes data within process streams.
There will also be many Sagent APP's (SAPP's) that define collections of sagents of a particular class.
For example, Sagent_S processes time history data within Pandas dataframes.
Thus, in Iceberg, there are classifications of processes that act on classifications of data.
3)The problem with complex processes; the information grows like a snowball rolling down hill.
In complex systems, we must use context referencing, or the code gets messy as more information is collected.
Instead, contextual information should be hidden in contextual referencing, like web "COOKIES".
In Iceberg Sagent processes, data called ICE defines the contextual information as a process executes.
Most of the parameters come from ICE that defines and controls information flow in the process instance.
Humans use this all the time. In English the word "THE" is used to define an assumed context.
To say "The dog" does not say which dog, unless "dog" is a contextual referencing for what came before.
When we read a book, we have no problem with using this context, unless we read the book backwards.
This "dog" assumes a dog.json file that could have hundreds of things about the dog instance in the process.
ICE is thus the short term contextual memory that flows with a process as it is executed.
4) Finally, Iceberg Instincts are arranged in hierarchical and SAPP modular decision trees.
There will be nodes, where there can be many possible paths that a process can take from that node.
Given a current data state at a node, a decision can be made towards a desired goal state.
In Iceberg all of human process knowledge can be defined as a giant decision tree.
Paths through the decision tree defines the process by which Iceberg acheives goals.

This README is only here as a very brief intoduction to Iceberg, and how it works.
